        <p class="text-1">Drive Thru by Fauna<br><br>A product of the fever dream that was covid 19. The song was written in the depths of a quarantine bedroom, dreaming of being on a tropical beach somewhere else. The purpose of the song is a reminder to live life to the fullest. The world offers so many wonders that it would be a shame to spend one's life locked up in their bedroom forever. </p>
        
        <p class="text-2">Cloud 9 by Fauna<br><br>A project that I started the summer after my senior year of highschool, which is only fitting that it will be released the summer after my senior year of college. The beginning and end both formulated in massive transitions of my life as I move from one thing to the next. The album is a collection of 9 songs that all embody the cloud 9 mindset. Each song displays my thoughts and feelings throughout my four years of college. It ranges through all of my emotions from Iâ€™m Yours to Trust Nobody. I hope that throughout Cloud 9, you too can find peace and tranquility.</p>
