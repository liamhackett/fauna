            <h1>Fauna</h1>
            <p>Fauna began in Phnom Penh, Cambodia within the Roteang Orphanage. Jack Halpin was born with the name “Mao,” which in Khmer means darkness. He was the youngest of ten, but only one of three that survived. He was then delivered to the Roteang Orphanage where he was given the name “Phearum,” which means peaceful and calm. Both given names equally represent the opposing sides of Flora and Fauna, or ying and yang. He chose to call himself Fauna as that correlates with the raw animal instincts of human behavior, as well as his birth name meaning darkness. However, he was given the light of Flora when given the name meaning peaceful and calm. He was then adopted by a family and grew up in Vergennes, Vermont. Given both sides of the ecosystem, he learned how to find the balance of Flora and Fauna with his new life in Vermont. Currently he is about to graduate from the University of Vermont with a bachelor's degree in Music Business and Technology with a minor in consumer and advertising. With a new chapter of life about to begin, keep a lookout for new music to come from his future adventures.</p>
